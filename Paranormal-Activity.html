                Sector 4A of the dimensional grid related 2 unusual entities wreaking havoc on isolated cities of the Chihuahuan Desert on Texas. Since last update from operatives no Fatal victims have been recorded. Although they produce a loud Tuba like melody who has left many with their auditive systems damaged and/or rendered completely unrecourevarable. Their objective is not clear yet, but they are determined to it whatever it is. <b>Reward: 5000 Ghostcoins.</b>

        <div class="headline"> <h1 class="Títulos">Recomendations</h1>
            <p>It is recomended to the operatives who wish to take the contract to take protective ear equipment, and Silver or Containment locks/spells. Long range weapons are also recomended so the shockwave of their music do not affect your reach of the anomalies.</p>
