                     From the same engineer team that brought you the MK3 and MK2 versions, GBT inc. newest iteration on the plasma coil gun is now available for testing! New version featuring a more efficient cooling mechanism to the plasma crystal Nucleus, and a new redesigned exterior for better gripping! <i><b>Available for 799 Ghostcoins.</b></i> </p>

                 <p>This amulet was recently recouvered by a affiliate exploration team of Ghosttech in an abandoned Tomb located in a
                     isolated arid desert. It's not clear what is exactly it's effects but the exploration team had members relating insolation effects. Although it's contained in a silver lock, we do recomend you only buy if you have the means of containment so it doesn't spiral off control. <i><b>Available for 300 Ghostcoins!</b></i>
                 </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                 <p>This is not much of a product, more of a project. To extend our partnership with the Wangsheng Funeral Parlour, Manager Hu Tao was kind enough to provide the blueprint of her famous staff for those who have Ghosttech partnership! So you can make the daredevil's favorite weapon against the darkness. <i><b>Available for free with Ghosttech partner program</b></i>
